# snake

[Play in the browser](https://snake.mcbrid.es)

I wanted a reason to play around with Svelte, and snake in the browser seemed like a fun thing to build. Controls are pretty simple:

- Press Start Game and the snake will start moving.
- Press an arrow key to move the snake around.
- Try to eat the apple. You eat the apple, the snake gets longer.
- Don't run into yourself.
- Walls loop around to the other side.

### Things I'm considering

- Adding a toggle to make wall collisions end the game, if you want "hard mode".
- Adding a slider to adjust the speed of the snake.
- Mobile controls, maybe a virtual keypad?
